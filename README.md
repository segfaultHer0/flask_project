Project Name: Project DataPath

Description: The plan for this project is to use Python and Flask to create an interactive data manipulation website.
  - Data will be either generated at runtime and stored in an in-memory database to be used by the program OR I will connect some open-source random data alternative database.
  - Users will be able to select a data structure, amount of data, and type of data that they would like to visualize and manipulate from the database.
  - The data will be displayed as a graph to the user.
  - The user will be able to select different algorithms to sort or manipulate the data.
  - The sorted or manipulated data will be displayed to the user.
  - The time and space complexity of the operation performed will be displayed to the user.


Current Support:
- Application powered by Flask
- Web page display
- Bootstrapped CSS
- Functioning links for the navigation bar
